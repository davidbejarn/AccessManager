# AccessManager
## Vehicle Access Control System  

## Overview  
The **Vehicle Access Control System** is a Java-based application designed to streamline and manage vehicle access efficiently. The system ensures secure entry and exit for vehicles by keeping track of details such as license plates, timestamps, and authorized entries.  

## Why Java?  
Java was chosen for its platform independence, robustness, and wide range of libraries. Its Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features make it an excellent choice for building structured and scalable systems like this.  

## Features  
- **Registration of Vehicles:** Add and update vehicle records.  
- **Access Logs:** Maintain a detailed history of entries and exits.  
- **Authorization Management:** Define and manage authorized vehicles.  
- **Reporting:** Generate logs and summaries for auditing purposes.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Java:** Core application logic.  
- **JDBC (Optional):** For database interaction (if persistence is implemented).  
- **JavaFX (Optional):** For a user-friendly GUI interface.  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davidbejarn/AccessManager.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).


## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a database for persistent data storage.

- Adding role-based access controls.

- Implementing a web-based interface for remote access.
